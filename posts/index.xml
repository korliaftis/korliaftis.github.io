      <description>Everything we have done so far was just setting the stage for our real goal, which is getting our hands dirty with the Rust programming language. It&amp;rsquo;s a modern engineering marvel destined to make all other languages obsolete. Either we jump on the Rust wagon now or get left behind with the memory-unsafe losers.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We now have a working system with several tools installed but in most cases we want these tools to work together and reach a specific state before we can start using them. Once we define what that state should look like we also need a simple way to create and tear down environments as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my use case, that state includes a Kubernetes cluster running Traefik, Prometheus and Argo CD. I automate the environment creation process with a Bash script and Terraform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I started working with computers I always loved the idea of a homelab, a safe space to mess with stuff, break stuff and sometimes learn a few things along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I was trying to land my first tech job my homelab was a bunch of noisy Cisco switches and routers. Along the way I discovered GNS3 and eventually those physical switches and routers were virtualized on my Sony Vaio VGN-N31Z with it&amp;rsquo;s Core 2 Duo, 2GB of RAM and 120GB of spinning rust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
